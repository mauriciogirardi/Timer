### :hammer: About the application

This is a Pomodoro application, a very important part of this method is the listing of the tasks that you must perform during the day and it is essential that this step is carried out correctly. It may seem like this is a simple task, but not everyone can do it so easily.

When you have a routine pre-established by your school, course or work, this part of the organization of your day often comes more or less ready for you and doesn't require much effort.
